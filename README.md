## 1. Introduction

The growth of AI and deep learning has amplified the demand for high-performance hardware accelerators capable of efficiently handling large computations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in particular, are widely used in tasks like image recognition but often require significant computational power, leading to challenges in latency and power consumption. Traditional digital accelerators handle these computations but can be inefficient for real-time applications. This report presents a low-power analog accelerator that performs core CNN operations, including multiplication, accumulation, activation (ReLU), and pooling, while avoiding digital conversion where possible.

### Problem Statement

In digital CNN accelerators, the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations consume considerable power and introduce latency due to digital-to-analog (D/A) and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversions. Analog circuits, by contrast, can perform these operations directly with minimal energy consumption and without the need for digital representation, potentially providing real-time inference with lower power consumption.

## 2. Circuit Design and Mathematical Formulation

### 2.1 Current-Steering Digital-to-Analog Converters (8-bit and 4-bit DACs)

The DACs convert binary digital values to analog currents, essential for initiating the convolution operation. This project includes an 8-bit DAC multiplier and a 4-bit DAC multiplier to explore the trade-offs in precision and power consumption.

**Schematic (8-bit Current Steering DAC):**

**Schematic (4-bit Current Steering DAC):**
![4-bit Current Steering DAC](4bit_dac_waveform.png)

#### Mathematical Formulation

For an $$\( n \)$$-bit DAC with a digital input $$\( D \)$$ (in decimal) and reference current $$\( I_{ref} \)$$, the output current $$\( I_{out} \)$$ is given by:

$$[I_{out} = (D / 2^n) * I_{ref}]$$(images/dac_equation.svg)

- $$\( D \)$$: Decimal representation of the binary input.
- $$\( n \)$$: Number of bits in the DAC.
- $$\( I_{ref} \)$$: Reference current.

The 8-bit DAC provides higher precision, while the 4-bit DAC is more power-efficient, making it suitable for applications where lower precision is acceptable.

### 2.2 Multiplier Circuits for DACs

The multiplier circuit uses current mirrors to multiply the DAC output with another analog input. The circuit configuration allows precise scaling through transistor sizing, supporting both 8-bit and 4-bit multipliers.

**Schematic (8-bit Multiplier):**
![8-bit Multiplier Circuit](images/8bit_multiplier_schematic.png)

**Schematic (4-bit Multiplier):**
![4-bit Multiplier Circuit](images/4bit_multiplier_schematic.png)

#### Mathematical Formulation

The output current $$\( I_{out} \)$$ of the multiplier circuit depends on the DAC output $$\( I_{DAC} \)$$, an additional input current $$\( I_{in} \)$$, and transistor ratios $$\( k_1 \)$$ and $$\( k_2 \)$$. For a general analog multiplier:

$$[I_{out} = k_1 * I_{DAC} * k_2 * I_{in}]$$(images/multiplier_equation.svg)

where:
- $$\( k_1 \)$$ and $$\( k_2 \)$$ represent scaling factors from transistor (W/L) ratios.
- $$\( I_{DAC} \)$$: DAC output current.
- $$\( I_{in} \)$$: Secondary input current.

This output is directly proportional to the product of $$\( I_{DAC} \)$$ and $$\( I_{in} \)$$, implementing a multiplication operation in the analog domain.

### 2.3 Analog Integrator for Accumulation

The integrator sums the products generated by the multiplier circuit, combining results from multiple operations without A/D conversion, which reduces power and latency.

**Schematic:**
![Analog Integrator](images/integrator_schematic.png)

#### Mathematical Formulation

For an integrator with capacitance $$\( C \)$$ and input current $$\( I_{in} \)$$, the output voltage $$\( V_{out} \)$$ over time $$\( t \)$$ is given by:

$$[V_{out(t)} = (1 / C) * int_{t = 0}^t I_{in} dt + V_{initial}]$$(images/integrator_equation.svg)

This formulation shows the continuous accumulation of input current over time, providing the summation needed in MAC operations.

### 2.4 Max Pooling Circuit

The max pooling circuit performs down-sampling by retaining the maximum value within a region. This circuit outputs the highest current value from a set, representing the maximum activation in analog form.

**Schematic:**
![Max Pooling Circuit](images/max_pooling_schematic.png)

#### Mathematical Formulation

For inputs $$\( \{I_1, I_2, \dots, I_n\} \)$$, the max pooling circuit outputs:

$$\[
I_{max} = \max(I_1, I_2, \dots, I_n)
\]$$

This reduces data while retaining essential features, making it a crucial component in CNNs.

### 2.5 ReLU Circuit for Activation Function

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) introduces non-linearity into the network by zeroing out negative values while allowing positive values to pass.

**Schematic:**
![ReLU Circuit](images/relu_schematic.png)

#### Mathematical Formulation

For an input current $$\( I_{in} \)$$, the output $$\( I_{out} \)$$ is given by:

$$\[
I_{out} = \max(0, I_{in})
\]$$
